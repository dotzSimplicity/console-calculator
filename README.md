# Python Console Calculator

This is a stupid python calculator i made which all works in the console, Why not a window and be actually smart? Because i made this on a school chromebook when my pc was broken.

The program doesnt feature too much except for simple math such as Plus, Minus, Division and Multiplication, However also has a square root feature.

This program was supposed to have much more such as a feature that checks if the variables are numbers and if the math thing was valid, however i stopped when i realized how bad i actually was in python.
